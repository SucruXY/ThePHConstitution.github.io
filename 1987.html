                        <p class="text-muted1">Cory Aquino stood against Marcos in a presidential election and when he won, more than a million Filipinos marched to the streets in 1986 to protest President Ferdinand Marcos' corrupt and cruel regime. It was called the People Power Revolution. President Corazon Aquino then created the 1986 Constitutional Commission (ConCom) during April 1986 through Proclamation No. 9 which was responsible for the drafting of the replacement of the 1973 Constitution. According to accounts, members of the ConCom engaged in heated debates during the various sessions on many issues, including the death penalty, economic policies, land reform, form of government, and even the retention of American military bases in Clark and Subic, among others (Gavilan, 2016). </p>

                        <h4 class="my-3">How it came to be</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted1">President Corazon Aquino was given three choices during the early months of her presidency as a president installed through the People Power Revolution: reestablish the 1935 Constitution, keep and modify the 1973 Constitution, or pass a new constitution. She chose to write a new constitution and issued Proclamation No. 3 on March 25, 1986, which revoked many of the elements of the 1973 Constitution, including the unicameral legislature (Batasang Pambansa), the Prime Minister's office, and provisions giving the President legislative power. </p>

                        <p class="text-muted1">President Corazon Aquino established the 1986 Constitutional Commission (ConCom) in April 1986 with Proclamation No. 9, which was mandated with developing a revision for the 1973 Constitution. She stated that the new constitution should be "truly representative of the Filipino people's aspirations and ideals." Soon, the 1987 Philippine Constitution followed.

                                    <p>Probably the most notable contribution of the 1987 Constitution today is the establishment of a representative democracy with power divided among three separate and independent branches of government: the Executive, a bicameral Legislature, and the Judiciary. It also established three independent constitutional commissions, namely the Commission on Audit, the Civil Service Commission, and the Commission on Elections. The Constitution included a full Bill of Rights (Article 3) that guaranteed fundamental civil and political rights as well as free, fair, and periodic elections. All these seemed ideal for many Filipinos compared to the document Marcos had that made political repression and oppression easier for him.</p>

                                    <h2 class="text-uppercase">Three Government Branches</h2>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/d2.jpg" alt="..." />
                                    <p>The executive branch is headed by the President—head of the state and chief executive—and his appointed cabinet members. The President is still subject to significant checks from the other branches intended to be a safeguard considering the long history of Marcos’ despotism. In cases of national emergency, the President can still declare martial law not longer than 60 days, which can also be revoked or extended by the Congress through a majority vote. The declaration can also be reviewed by the Supreme Court for sufficient facts to justify the martial law. The President can make or accept foreign loans but cannot enter treaties without the consent of the Senate. Lastly, the President can only serve one six-year term.</p>
                                    <p>The legislative power is vested in a Congress which is divided into two Houses: the Senate and the House of Representatives. There are 24 members of the Senate, serving not more than two consecutive six-year terms, while the House is composed of 250 elected members. One of the most important powers of the Congress is its ability to declare war besides the exclusive power to legislate. This ability to declare is possible through a two-thirds vote in both houses. The power to legislate is still subject to an executive check, meaning the President has the power to veto the bill passed by both Houses. The Congress, however, may also override this veto only with a two-thirds vote in both houses.</p>
                                    <p>The Court system in the Philippines that exercises judicial power is composed of a Supreme Court and lower courts created by law. The fifteen-member Supreme Court is appointed by the President without the Congress’ confirmation. It oversees the functioning and administration of the lower courts and their personnel. A list of nominees for appointment is presented to the President by a constitutionally-specified Judicial and Bar Council composing of seven members: the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Secretary of Justice, a representative from Congress, a representative of the Integrated Bar, a law professor, a retired member of the Supreme Court, and a representative of the private sector. On appeal, the Supreme Court Justices may hear cases involving the constitutionality of any government law, treaty, or decree, questions of judicial error, or cases where the penalty is sufficiently severe. It may also exercise jurisdiction over cases involving government or international officials.</p>

                                    <p>The Civil Service Commission, Commission on Elections, and Commission on Audit are three independent constitutional commissions established by the 1987 Constitution. To ensure impartial decision-making, each of these Commissions is given governing and financial autonomy from the other branches of government. </p>
                                    <p>The Supreme Court has the authority to review all decisions made by these commissions as well. The Constitution also established the Office of the Ombudsman, which investigates complaints about public corruption, unlawful behavior by public officials, and other forms of public misconduct, charged before a special court called Sandiganbayan. The Ombudsman is administratively and financially independent from other branches, although the President still has the authority to appoint the Ombudsman and his Deputies for single seven-year terms. The House, members of the Supreme Court, and a few other constitutionally protected public officials like the Ombudsman are the only ones who have the power to impeach the President. </p>
                                    <p>All these are established by the 1987 Constitution with the goal of promoting moral and ethical behavior in government, and to avoid repeating the horrors made under the Marcos’ administration.</p>

                                    <p>The 1987 Philippine Constitution took the place of the 1986 "Freedom Constitution" after it was ratified in 1987. It has declared a National Policy to carry out the reforms demanded by the people, preserve their Basic Rights, approve a Provisional Constitution, and provide a smooth transition to a new constitution-based administration. </p>
                                    <p>Some provisions of the 1973 Constitution, such as the principle of separation of powers, the proper way of making a bill into a law, and the bill of rights, which includes our political, cultural, social, spiritual, and civil rights, have been adopted if they are not in conflict with the proclamation. It gave the President considerable authority to restructure government and discharge officials, as well as requiring him to convene a committee to draft a new, more formal Constitution. It was a paper that genuinely reflected the Filipino people's ideas and ambitions. The Congress is once again in charge of enacting legislation. The Republic form of government, as defined by the 1987 Constitution, was the same type of republican government that existed prior to the 1935 Constitution's declaration of martial law, with three co-equal branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.</p>

                                    <p>Nonetheless, this does not mean that this constitution did not have its fair share of flaws. Filipinos in the late 1960s believed that it only provided a democratic political cloak for a greatly oligarchic society. This then prompted a constitutional convention held to rewrite the basic law of the land for its improvement by omitting parts that are deemed unsuitable for a genuinely Filipino constitution whilst preserving its democratic core. This, however, was not completed as intended due to Marcos’ declaration of the Martial Law that gave rise to the 1973 constitution (The Library of Congress Country Studies, 1991).
