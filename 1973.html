                        <p class="text-muted1">President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law during September 1972 and later on he manipulated the ongoing Constitutional Convention during that time which led to the drafting of the 1973 constitution. He then issued Proclamation No. 1102 certifying that the 1973 Constitution had been ratified by the Filipino people and thereby was in effect.

                        <p class="text-muted1"><i>“This proclamation was questioned in Javellana v. Executive Secretary, which saw the Supreme Court severely divided on the issues. Despite the voting, the Court decision stated in its dispositive portion that, “This being the vote of the majority, there is no further judicial obstacle to the new Constitution being considered in force and effect.” In that case then, there is no Supreme Court ruling that the 1973 Constitution has been validly ratified because six out of ten Justices held that there was no valid ratification in accordance with Article XV, Section 1 of the 1935 Constitution, which provides only one way for ratification, i.e., “in an election or plebiscite held in accordance with law and participated in only by qualified and duly registered voters”(La Viña, 2016.)

                        <h4 class="my-3">How it shaped our Nation</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted1">Through the 1973 constitution, Marcos  became more powerful. According to an article by La Viña (2016), the 1973 Constitution was turned into a tool by the Marcos regime to perpetuate itself in power. During its lifetime, several amendments to the 1973 Constitution were introduced. These were initially either initiated primarily to perpetuate Marcos’ one-man- rule, as exemplified by the aforementioned Amendment No. 6, or introduced to construct some semblance of democracy to his unpopular regime by experimenting with various political systems like the French presidential system. The referenda and plebiscites that were conducted to ratify the amendments were all rigged, orchestrated, and made possible by his total control of governmental agencies like the bureaucracy, the military, and the Supreme Court.

                                    <p>The 1973 Constitution, which consists of a preamble and 17 articles, outlines the transition from a presidential to parliamentary governance. The National Assembly has legislative power under the Constitution. A Prime Minister is appointed from among the members of the National Assembly and served as the country's chief executive and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. A President is chosen from among the members of the National Assembly and is elected for a six-year term as the symbolic head of state. The Supreme Court, which is made up of a Chief Justice and 14 Justices, has judicial power. The National Assembly has the authority to define, prescribe, and distribute the lower courts' jurisdiction. The Prime Minister appoints all Supreme Court justices as well as judges in lower courts.

                                    <p>Ferdinand Marcos was elected President of the Philippines in 1965 and re-elected in 1969, making him the first president to do so. He imposed martial law in 1972, just before the conclusion of his second and final term, in order to stay in power beyond his legal term. He cited a rising communist insurrection as grounds. He then utilized a stalling Constitutional Convention to force the development of a new constitution – the 1973 Constitution – that allowed him to rule by decree until 1978, when the 1935 Constitution's presidential system was replaced by a parliamentary one. The draft Constitution was presented to the Citizen's Assemblies for ratification from January 10 to 17, 1973. Marcos continued to power under this new regime and regained control by fiat, repressing democratic institutions and restricting civil liberties. President Ferdinand Marcos issued Proclamation No. 1102, declaring the approval of the Philippine Constitution on January 17, 1973. </p>

                                    <p>The 1973 Constitution was the Marcos Constitution. One of the obvious differences between the present day 1987 Constitution and the 1973 Constitution is that the latter has no term limits. It was open for re-election after serving one 6-year term. This Constitution was very prone to manipulation and abuse by people in power or of higher positions. President Ferdinand E. Marcos was able to assert authoritarian control through brilliantly undermining the democratic principles of the Philippine Constitution during his regime, particularly the Bill of Rights that was intended to provide protection for the civil and political rights of the individual against possible abuse of state powers, the separation of powers, the mechanism of checks and balances as well as the manipulative control over the dominant forces of the Philippines that provided support for his rule.</p>
                                    <p>It is therefore safe to say that the 1973 Constitution provided a way for the current Constitution to improve and strengthen its laws to prevent the things that have happened during Marcos’ administration. Although for many Filipinos, the present day 1987 Constitution is said to be far from perfect, yet it is still evident that it is way better than its preceding Constitution.

Unfortunately, uncertainties occurred which brought major problems to the country in terms of the economy due to the great depression or the intense decline in the country’s global economy.

                                    <p>It is without a doubt that the 1935 constitution throughout its run gave the Philippines a steadfast constitutional government especially at a time when many fellow Asian nations underwent dictatorships or communist revolutions. In fact, it has been considered as the best-written Philippine charter ever (Palafox, 2012).</p>
                                    <p>The Commonwealth, driven by this constitution, started most of the government institutions we have at present such as the Executive Office (1935), Court of Appeals (1935), National Bureau of Investigation (1936), Government Service Insurance System (1936), Department of Health (1940) and more, as well as the policies that call for an all-Filipino supreme court (1935), minimum daily wage (1936), and national language (1939) (Official Gazette, n.d.). This era also reinforced the incorporation of cities under special charters which started during the American colonial period.

                                    <p>Nonetheless, this does not mean that this constitution did not have its fair share of flaws. Filipinos in the late 1960s believed that it only provided a democratic political cloak for a greatly oligarchic society. This then prompted a constitutional convention held to rewrite the basic law of the land for its improvement by omitting parts that are deemed unsuitable for a genuinely Filipino constitution whilst preserving its democratic core. This, however, was not completed as intended due to Marcos’ declaration of the Martial Law that gave rise to the 1973 constitution (The Library of Congress Country Studies, 1991).
